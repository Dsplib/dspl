\example resample_spline_filter_frac_delay.c  
This program calculates the characteristics of Farrow filter to compensate the fractional delay from 0 to 1. 
It uses Farrow filter on the basis of spline interpolation.

It calculates the filter reaction to one delta-impulse and plots the filter magnitude and the group delay.

Operation results of the program are saved in files.<BR><BR>
