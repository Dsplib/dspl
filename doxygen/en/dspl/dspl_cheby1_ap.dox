	\brief Analog Chebyshev type 1 filter prototype.
	
	Function calculates Analog Chebyshev type 1 filter transfer function \f$H(s)\f$ coefficients.
	Filter has order `ord`  cutoff frequency 1 rad/s with distortion level `-Rp` dB in passband 
	(from 0 rad/s to 1 rad/s). Chebyshev type 1 filter magnitude is equiripple in passband.
	
	\param[in]	Rp	Filter passband distortions dB.
					Distortions level from 0 rad/s to 1 rad/s. 
					Must be positive.
					
	\param[in]	ord Filter order. 
					Transfer function  \f$H(s)\f$ numerator and denominator 
					coefficients number is `ord+1`.
					
	\param[out]	b 	Transfer function  \f$H(s)\f$ numerator coefficients vector pointer.
					Vector size is `[ord+1 x 1]`.
					Memory must be allocated.
										
	\param[out]	a 	Transfer function  \f$H(s)\f$ denominator coefficients vector pointer.
					Vector size is `[ord+1 x 1]`.
					Memory must be allocated.
					
	\return
		`DSPL_OK`				Filter is calculated successfully .<BR>
		`DSPL_ERROR_FILTER_RP`	Parameter `Rp` must be positive. <BR>
		`DSPL_ERROR_FILTER_ORD`	Filter order must be positive.<BR>
		`DSPL_ERROR_PTR`		Pointers `b` and `a` cannot be as `NULL`.<BR>
